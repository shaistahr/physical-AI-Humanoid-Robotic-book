# Study Overview
# Overview

The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the physical world. This capstone quarter introduces **Physical AI**—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws. Students learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions using **ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac**.

## Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
**Focus:** Middleware for robot control.
*   ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services.
*   Bridging Python Agents to ROS controllers using `rclpy`.
*   Understanding URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for humanoids.

## Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
**Focus:** Physics simulation and environment building.
*   Simulating physics, gravity, and collisions in Gazebo.
*   High-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction in Unity.
*   Simulating sensors: LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs.

## Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
**Focus:** Advanced perception and training.
*   NVIDIA Isaac Sim: Photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation.
*   Isaac ROS: Hardware-accelerated VSLAM (Visual SLAM) and navigation.
*   Nav2: Path planning for bipedal humanoid movement.

## Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
**Focus:** The convergence of LLMs and Robotics.
*   Voice-to-Action: Using OpenAI Whisper for voice commands.
*   Cognitive Planning: Using LLMs to translate natural language ("Clean the room") into a sequence of ROS 2 actions.
*   **Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid.** A final project where a simulated robot receives a voice command, plans a path, navigates obstacles, identifies an object using computer vision, and manipulates it.
