    *   **Payload Capacity:** Designed to lift and move objects weighing up to 35 lbs (16 kg), focusing on practical material handling.
    *   **Energy Efficiency:** Optimized for long operational shifts through efficient gait generation and power management.
    *   **Teleoperation/Supervised Autonomy:** Often deployed with a human-in-the-loop for supervision and complex task initiation, gradually moving towards full autonomy.
*   **Distinguishing Philosophy:** Specialization in mobile manipulation within human-centric industrial environments, prioritizing robust locomotion and practical payload handling.

## 3.4 Sanctuary AI Phoenix

**Overview:** Sanctuary AI's Phoenix robot aims to create general-purpose humanoids capable of performing any human task. Their "general purpose AI" (GPAI) approach emphasizes broad human-like intelligence and dexterity.

*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Cognitive Architecture (Carbon):** Utilizes a proprietary AI control system called "Carbon" designed for human-like reasoning, planning, and task execution, allowing the robot to learn new tasks rapidly (Anon. et al., 2025). Their approach emphasizes "general purpose AI" (GPAI).
    *   **Human-like Dexterity:** Features highly sophisticated, sensor-rich hands with exceptional articulation to mimic human hand movements for complex manipulation.    *   **Safety-First Design:** Emphasizes safety protocols and human-robot interaction design, given its general-purpose ambitions.
*   **Intended Use Cases:** A broad spectrum of tasks, from retail and hospitality to cleaning and manufacturing, aiming for maximum versatility.
*   **Distinguishing Philosophy:** Focus on comprehensive, human-like general intelligence and dexterity, striving to enable robots to adapt to any human task without extensive re-programming.
